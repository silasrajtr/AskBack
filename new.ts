That's a fantastic idea to make your chatbot even smarter and more helpful! You're essentially looking to give your AI the ability to have a more natural, back-and-forth clarifying conversation, much like a human would.

The documentation you provided, especially Chapters 2 ("AI State & Actions") and 3 ("Generative UI Tools"), lays out the perfect foundation for building this. Think of your chatbot as a super-assistant. Sometimes, when you give it a task, it might need to ask a follow-up question to make sure it understands perfectly. Your proposed mechanism is exactly how you'd enable that!

Here's how you can extend your project to achieve this:

1. The AI's Brain: Deciding to Ask for Clarification (AI State & Actions)
Just like you remember what you've talked about, your chatbot needs a "memory" and "skills."

AI State (Memory): This is where your chatbot keeps track of the conversation so far, including user inputs and its own internal thoughts. When the user gives an ambiguous prompt like "I wanna edit a video with a 3d asset in it," the AI processes this. Its "brain" needs to realize: "Hmm, this user wants video editing, but do they know the tools? And what about 3D models?" The AI State will remember this initial prompt.

AI Actions (Skills): These are like specialized "superpowers" you give your AI. Instead of just replying with text, the AI can "call" an action to perform a specific task, like start_quiz, show_answer, or in your case, a new action we'll call ask_clarifying_question.

The magic happens in your app/action.tsx file, where your AI's intelligence lives. When submitUserMessage receives a new prompt, your AI model (e.g., OpenAI's GPT) processes it. You'd instruct your AI in its "system prompt" (like its core instructions) that if a user's request is unclear, it should use your new ask_clarifying_question tool.

Here’s a simplified look at how you'd define this new skill within your AI's toolkit in app/action.tsx:

// File: app/action.tsx (simplified)
import { getMutableAIState, render, createAI } from 'ai/rsc';
import OpenAI from 'openai'; // Assuming you're using OpenAI
import { z } from 'zod'; // For defining expected parameters

// ... (other imports and setup like your OpenAI instance) ...

export async function submitUserMessage(content: string) {
  'use server';

  const aiState = getMutableAIState<typeof AI>();
  aiState.update([...aiState.get(), { role: 'user', content }]);

  const ui = render({
    provider: openai,
    model: 'gpt-4-0125-preview',
    messages: [
      {
        role: 'system',
        content: `You are an AI assistant. If a user's request for video editing 
                  or 3D work is ambiguous, you MUST use the 'ask_clarifying_question' tool 
                  to gather more information. Provide a clear question and multiple relevant options.`,
      },
      ...aiState.get().map((info: any) => ({
        role: info.role,
        content: info.content,
        name: info.name,
      })),
    ],
    initial: <BotMessage className="items-center">{spinner}</BotMessage>, // Loading state
    tools: {
      // Your new clarifying question tool!
      ask_clarifying_question: {
        description: 'Ask the user a clarifying question with options to get more details for an ambiguous prompt.',
        parameters: z.object({
          question: z.string().describe('The clarifying question to ask the user.'),
          options: z.array(z.string()).describe('A list of possible answers for the user to select.'),
          // You might add a 'followUpAction' parameter here for the AI to know what to do next
        }).required(),
        render: async function*({ question, options }) {
          // 1. Show a temporary loading state
          yield <BotCard><QuizQuestionSkeleton /></BotCard>; // Re-using a quiz skeleton
          
          // 2. Update AI's memory that a clarifying question was asked
          aiState.done([
            ...aiState.get(),
            { role: 'function', name: 'ask_clarifying_question', content: JSON.stringify({ question, options }) },
          ]);

          // 3. Return the actual UI component for the question
          return <BotCard><ClarifyingQuestion question={question} options={options} /></BotCard>;
        }
      },
      // ... other existing tools like start_quiz, display_result
    }
  });

  return { id: Date.now(), display: ui };
}

// ... (createAI setup) ...
export const AI: any = createAI({ /* ... actions including submitUserMessage ... */ });
In this simplified code:

We've added a new ask_clarifying_question tool within the tools object of the render function.
Its description helps the AI know when to use it.
Its parameters define the data the AI needs to provide (the question and options). We use zod to ensure the AI gives us the right format.
The render function is the key: it first yields a temporary loading state, then updates the AI's memory that this tool was used, and finally returns a special UI component, <ClarifyingQuestion />.
2. The Interactive UI: Presenting Questions and Options (Generative UI Tools)
This is where "Generative UI" shines! Instead of just sending plain text, your AI can tell the application to display a dynamic, interactive component. The quiz_question tool in the documentation is a perfect example of this. You'll create a similar component for your clarifying questions.

The <ClarifyingQuestion /> component will be a standard React component (similar to components/quiz/quiz-question.tsx in your documentation) that receives the question and options from the AI. It will then render these as interactive buttons or radio choices.

Here's a conceptual look at what your ClarifyingQuestion component might involve:

// File: components/clarifying-question.tsx (simplified)
'use client';

import React from 'react';
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'; // Using Shadcn/UI buttons
import { useActions } from 'ai/rsc';
import { type AI } from '@/app/action'; // Link to your AI's brain

export function ClarifyingQuestion({ question, options }: { question: string; options: string[] }) {
  const { submitClarification } = useActions<typeof AI>(); // We'll define this action next!

  const handleOptionSelect = async (selectedOption: string) => {
    // Send the user's selected option back to the AI
    await submitClarification(selectedOption);
  };

  return (
    <div className="max-w-xl mx-auto p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md">
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg font-semibold">{question}</p>
      <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
        {options.map((option, index) => (
          <Button key={index} onClick={() => handleOptionSelect(option)}>
            {option}
          </Button>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
This ClarifyingQuestion component doesn't know what the question is, only how to display any question with its options as interactive buttons. The AI generates the content, and this component renders it.

3. Closing the Loop: Getting User Input Back to the AI
Once the user selects an option, you need to send that information back to your AI so it can refine its understanding and generate a final good response.

New AI Action for User Response: You'll need another AI Action (let's call it submitClarification) in your app/action.tsx file. This action will be called by your ClarifyingQuestion component when a user clicks an option.
Update AI State: The submitClarification action will receive the user's selected option and update the AI State (memory). Now, the AI knows the answer to its clarifying question!
Final Response: With this new information in its memory, the AI can then process the original prompt again, now with better context, and generate a precise, helpful response.
Here's how the submitClarification action would fit into app/action.tsx:

// File: app/action.tsx (continued - simplified)
// ... (imports and existing submitUserMessage function) ...

// Define the new action that receives the user's clarification
export async function submitClarification(selectedOption: string) {
  'use server';

  const aiState = getMutableAIState<typeof AI>();
  aiState.update([
    ...aiState.get(),
    { role: 'user', content: `User clarified: ${selectedOption}`, name: 'clarification_response' },
  ]);

  // Now, the AI has the clarification. Let it process and generate a final response.
  const ui = render({
    provider: openai,
    model: 'gpt-4-0125-preview',
    messages: [
      {
        role: 'system',
        content: `You are an AI assistant. You have just received clarification from the user. 
                  Use all available context to provide a complete and helpful response.`,
      },
      ...aiState.get().map((info: any) => ({
        role: info.role,
        content: info.content,
        name: info.name,
      })),
    ],
    // This time, you might just expect a text response
    text: ({ content, done }) => {
      if (done) {
        aiState.done([...aiState.get(), { role: 'assistant', content }]);
      }
      return <BotMessage>{content}</BotMessage>;
    },
    // No tools needed here, as the AI is just responding with text based on new info
    tools: {
      // Your existing tools go here, but the AI won't call them in this specific "response" phase
    }
  });

  return { id: Date.now(), display: ui };
}

// ... (createAI setup - remember to add submitClarification to the actions list) ...
export const AI: any = createAI({
  actions: {
    submitUserMessage,
    submitClarification, // Add your new action here!
    // ... other actions
  },
  initialUIState: [],
  initialAIState: [],
});
